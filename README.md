The objective of this project is to investigate greenhouse gas emissions in Canada across years, provinces and sectors. Specific facilities (and their respective industry) that have significantly high emissions will also be analyzed. Trends across time and differences between provinces with regards to emission levels and emission-heavy sectors will be identified.
